## Test The Authentication Api : 
After the project solution is successfully generated as per the mentioned project structure. After the project is successfully build, let's access the authentication api.

The first step is to hit the authentication api get method, it should be authorized through inserting the value in the authorize button and then after the post method is called. After the new token is generated it is authorized using the authorize button. 

> This is done to prevent brute force attacks.
